                <p>First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to
                    other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser
                    would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as
                    the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of
                    the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety
                    of other effects. CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

                    in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

                    in building the original database; they devised MariaDB in 2009 in response to Oracle Corp.'s acquisition of MySQL. MariaDB is based on SQL and supports ACID-style data processing with guaranteed atomicity, consistency, isolation and
                    durability for transactions. Among other features, the database also supports JSON APIs, parallel data replication and multiple storage engines, including InnoDB, MyRocks, Spider, Aria, TokuDB, Cassandra and MariaDB ColumnStore.

                    it was renamed C++ in 1983. C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

                <p>Rust is a statically and strongly typed systems programming language. statically means that all types are known at compile-time, strongly means that these types are designed to make it harder to write incorrect programs. A successful compilation
                    means you have a much better guarantee of correctness than with a cowboy language like C. systems means generating the best possible machine code with full control of memory use. So the uses are pretty hardcore: operating systems,
                    device drivers and embedded systems that might not even have an operating system. However, it's actually a very pleasant language to write normal application code in as well. The big difference from C and C++ is that Rust is safe by
                    default; all memory accesses are checked. It is not possible to corrupt memory by accident.
